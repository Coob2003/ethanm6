# Description  
A solution to the problem explained by reddit user /u/ethanm6 in a post in the subreddit /r/Discord_Bots  
https://www.reddit.com/r/Discord_Bots/comments/pp5bya/i_would_like_a_bot_that_sends_a_message_to_a_text/hde2twu/  
  
# Instructions  
Note: requires node.js 16.6 or higher, as it is using discord.js v13  
  
- Clone repository and navigate to the folder in a CLI such as Bash or Powershell  
- Enter "npm i" to install dependancies  
- Edit values in config.json to match your use case, note that you will need developer mode enabled in discord to get IDs  
- In CLI, enter "node index.js". After a few seconds, it would reply with "Bot online"  
- Profit
